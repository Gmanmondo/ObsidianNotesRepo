# Boskic's Lenses
## Ethics of the Medium

## Ethics of the Design
- 
## Ethics of the Play and the Player

## Teaching Ethics Through Games

# Two Approaches to Moral Engagement
## Empathy Through Games
### The Good
- Games like Journey reward the player with bonuses like flying stamina or being near another player
- Similarly, players are only able to communicate by a single sound they make in order to minimize verbal harassment.
- You can still troll though.
### The Bad
- In *Designing Ourselves*, Schrier writes something along the lines of making people take on another perspective can be harmful because it can bring about stereotypes or stigmas toward another group.
- Empathy is not purely good: instead, it needs to be used carefully in contexts where players are encouraged to critically reflect on their experiences.

## Teaching Ethics vs. Teaching Skills Associated with Ethics
- Games can give players a better "moral imagination"
- **Design features that increase moral imagination**
	- **Emotional investment**
		- Through Characters, stories, tasks
		- Designing for this is difficult
		- Some genres do not easily suit emotional investment beyond the player's immediate feelings.
	- **Choice & Consequences**
		- Giving players chances to exercise agency or engage their moral imagination.
		- Relationship between choices and consequences must be clear
		- Easy to get wrong
	- **Obstacles**
		- Can make a player stop and reconsider their options
		- Some game genres value pauses to think, while others punish them, but use of obstacles to encourage thinking in this context should not be a punishment
	- **Permanence**
		- Part of what gives choices consequences
		- Can drive players to focus on strategic outcomes rater than moral ones
	
- Not every game has to use these or attempt to teach these skills
	- They are tools in your toolbox
	- You are not limited to these
