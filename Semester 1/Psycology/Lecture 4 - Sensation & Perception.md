# Sensation
- "Raw" information comes in thought the sense receptors (ears, eyes, nose, etc.)
- And is processed by the brain as "sensations"

We perceive the world as it is convenient to us

# Processing
## Transduction
- Converts sensory stimuli into neural impulses that are sent to the brain

## Sensory Reduction
- Filter and analyze incoming sensations before sending neural impulses on the brain

## Coding
- Neural impulses go to different parts of your brain allowing us to feel physical stimuli as distinct sensations

# Measurement Issues
## Detection
- How do we detect something?
	- Absolute Threshold
	- **At What point do you hear the volume? 1? 2? 3?**

## Discrimination
- How do we tell the difference between two different stimuli
	- Difference Threshold (just noticeable difference)
	- **At what point do you notice the difference in the volume? 4 -> 5? 4 -> 6? 4 -> 7?**

## Weakening Sensitivity
- Sensory Adaptation
- E.g. Going "Nose Blind"


# Vision
- Electromagnetic waves is visible light
- 400 -> 750 nm
## Light energy
- Frequency indicates color/hue
- Amplitude = intensity/brightness

## The Eye
- Pupil: Contracting black part that accepts light
- Iris: The color of your eye
- Sclera: The white of your eye
- Cornea: The bulge on the front eyeball

**Myopia**
Focuses the image before it hits the retina

### Photo Receptors
Turns photons of light into information
Only cones in Fovea
Cones and Rods in Periphery
**Cones**
- 6,000,000 per eye
- Sensitive to bright light
- Near center of eye
- Color vision and fine detail/Higher visual acuity
- Bright light conditions

**People are more sensitive to either RGB**!

**Rods**
- Prevalent in the outer edges of the eye
- 120,000,000
- Dim light conditions
- Don't produce colour
- Lower visual acuity
---
The Place where there are no photoreceptors (Where the optic nerve is) There is a blind spot

## Colour Vision
### Young-Helmholtz trichromatic theory
- Colour perception results from three types of cones
	- Red, Green and Blue
- Does not explain after-images

### Opponent-process theory
- Colour perception is based on three systems
	- Each contains two colour opposites
		- Red-Green, Blue-Yellow, Black-White
- Explains after-images


# Perception
## Selective Attention
- Filtering out and consciously focus on certain stimuli
	- E.g. Focus on one voice
## Feature Detectors
- Specialized neurons in the occipital lobe that respond to certain information
## Habituation
- The brain's reduced responsiveness due to repeated stimuli of the same receptors
---
## Perceptional Organization
### Form
- Top-Down Processing
	- Expectation of what you're going to see
	- Experiences
	- Things you've learned
- Bottom-Up Processing
	- Using things like edges, shadows, shape to make an image
	- The fundamental components

**Gestalt Laws of Perception**
"The whole is less than merely the sum of its parts"
### Organization
- Figure-Ground
	- What stands out
	- E.g. Two people kissing image
- Proximity
	- Naturally group things together by distance visually
- Similarity
	- Group similar items together, visually
- Continuity
	- Group together items that fit a patterns
	- E.g. Dog around the trash can
- Closure

### Depth
#### Monocular Cues
- Accommodation
- Relative Size
	- How big one thing is compared to another
- Relative Height 
	- Height off a horizon
- Linear Perspective
	- Lines in a drawing that lead to a conversion point
- Texture Gradient 
	- MipMap
- Interposition 
	- Something blocking by being in front
- Light and Shadow
	- Darker = Farther away from light 
- Atmospheric Haze
	- Like MipMap from hazy air
- Motion Parallax
	- Fixation point
	- Things seem to move horizontally slower the farther away they are

#### Binocular Cues
- Retinal Disparity
	- You see two perspectives of the same thing with both eyes
- Convergence
	- How much you feel your eyes turn inward

#### Perceptual Constancies
- Size Constancy
	- Size changes with distance but we know that we don't "grow" like that
	- Children don't have this
- Shape Constancy
	- Size doesn't change with orientation
- Colour/Brightness Constancy
	- Shadows don't "change" the colour of an object

### Interpretation
 - Perceptual Adaptation
	- Adapting to new sensory or refined information
	- Like when you get new glasses. You have to get "used to them"
 - Perceptual Set
	- Readiness to perceive in a particular manner based on expectations
	- ![[Pasted image 20251001191747.png]]
 - Frame of Reference
	- What it's being compared to
- Bottom-Up or Top-Down Processing
	- Top-Down Processing
		- Expectation of what you're going to see
		- Experiences
		- Things you've learned
	- Bottom-Up Processing
		- Using things like edges, shadows, shape to make an image
		- The fundamental components


# Nonvisual Senses
## Hearing
- Sound waves interfaces with ear
- Frequency
	- Pitch
- Amplitude
	- Intensity

## Anatomy of the Ear
![[Pasted image 20251001192540.png]]
### Outer Ear
- Pinna
- Auditory Canal
- Eardrum/Tympanic Membrane
### Middle Ear
- Ossicles/Smallest Bones
	- Hammer/Malleus
	- Anvil/Incus
	- Stirrup/Stapes
- Cochlea
	- Oval Window
	- Basilar Membrane
	- Nerve fibers
### Inner Ear
- Auditory nerve
- Auditory Cortex in Temporal Lobe
---
## Why Two Ears?
- Time difference between two ears gives you info on where sound source is
---
## Perceiving Pitch
- **Place Theory**
	- Different frequencies stimulate different parts of the Basilar Membrane
	- <5000Hz

- **Frequency Theory**
	- Different Frequencies cause different rates of neural firing
	- >5000Hz

---
## Hearing Loss
- Conduction Hearing Loss
	- Damage to the track that sound takes through the ear
		- Hearing Aids

- Sensorineural hearing loss
	- Damage to the cochlea receptor cells
	- Damage to auditory nerve
		- Outer Cochlea
---
## Body Position and Movement
- Kinesthesia
	- System that keeps track of body parts position
- Vestibular Sense
	- Fluid in your ear that keeps your balance
---
## Interactions
- Sensory Interaction
	- E.g. May have trouble hearing if mouth is covered and can't see

- Embodied Cognition
	- Interaction between physical sensations, gestures and thoughts
	- How you might perceive things based on your current mood or state of mind
