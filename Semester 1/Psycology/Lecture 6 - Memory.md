**What is memory?**
The persistence of learning over time through the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information

# Important Terms
- Recall
	- Retrieving information
- Recognition
	- Identifying items previously learned
- Relearning
	- Learning something faster the second time around
- Forgetting
	- Memories fade

# Memory Models
- Encoding
	- Getting it into memory
- Storage
	- sustaining the memory
- Retrieval
	- Getting the memory out

## Three-Stage Memory Model

If you pay attention to something, it typically gets moved to short term

---
### Sensory Register
- Really short
- For Iconic (visual) and echoic (auditory) sensory
- Iconic lasts around 1/2 seconds
- Echoic lasts around 2/4 seconds
---
### Short-term Memory
Briefly activated memory of a few items that is later stored or forgotten

- 30 seconds
- 5-9 different items

#### Miller's Magic Number
- The capacity of short term memory is 7, plus or minus 2, items of information

- Mnemonics
	- Memory aids, especially those techniques that use vivid imaginary and organizational devices
		- requires conscious attention and resources
		- Long-term memory can help create more enriched, meaningful and larger chunks
- Single use Mnemonics
	- Acronyms
	- Rhymes
	- Phrases
	- Personal Meaning
- Multiple use Mnemonics
	- Use sequences of locations that are already known
	- To recall items, mentally go through list of known pairs and remember this

#### Chunking
"IFYOUGROUPUPTOGETHERYOUREMEMBERBETTER"
Grouping information to remember better

#### Rehearsal
- Maintenance Rehearsal
	- Repeating information over and over to maintain it in short-term memory
- Rehearsal transfers info to long-term memory for more permanent retention

#### Spacing Effect
- Distributing practice yields better retention
	- Massed Practice
	- Distributed Practice
		- Testing effect

##### Individual Differences
Chess masters were better at remembering and reproducing a random chess board than a novice

#### What is in short-term memory?
- Verbal
	- Confuse auditory information

- Semantic
	- Proactive interference (PI)

- Visual
	- Mental rotation tasks

### Long-term Memory
- Varieties of Long-term Memory
	- Explicit Memory (Conscious recall)
		- Semantic Memory
			- Facts and general knowledge
			- E.g., Bananas are yellow, 12 months in a year
		- Episodic Memory
			- Personal experiences and events
			- E.g., Highschool graduation, birthday
	
	- Implicit Memory (Without conscious recall)
		- Procedural Memory
			- Motor skills and habits
			- E.g., How to drive a car, brushing your teeth (Difficult to describe verbally)
		- Classically Conditioned Memory
			- Conditioned responses to conditioned stimuli
			- E.g., phobias, prejudice, etc
		- Priming
			- Earlier exposure facilitates retrieval
			- E.g., jumpy after watching scary movie

#### Accuracy
- Technical Accuracy
	- Recalling exactly what happened
- Content Accuracy
	- Recalling the meaning or content of what was experienced

#### Autobiographical Memory
- Structure
	- Details
	- Interpretations

- Organization

- Types
	- Personal Memory
	- Autobiographical Fact
	- Generic Personal memory

#### Memory is Constructive
- Reproductive Memory
	- A highly accurate, verbatim recording of an event
- Reconstructive Memory
	- Remembering by combining elements of experience with existing knowledge (what we got)

#### Encoding-specificity Principle
- Retrieval of information is improved when conditions of recovery are similar to the conditions when information was encoded
	- Context-dependent
		- I only remember "spoon knife and fork" underwater
	- Mood-congruent
		- If you're happy when you learn something, you'll remember it if you're happy
	- State-dependent
		- If you study on caffeine, you may remember better on caffeine

#### Sequence Effects
- Serial-Position Curve
	-  You remember the things at the beginning and end of a sequence
	- Primacy/Recency effect

---
### How Do We Search Memory?
- Serial Self-terminating search (What our bodies do)
	- You search one place, then the next, then the next, etc.
	- Once it's found you stop

- Sternberg
	- Shown a string of 1-6 characters
	- Then a single character appears (probe)
	- Measure speed of response depending on
		- number
		- sequential position
		- answer

- Serial Exhaustive Search
	- Even though you found the answer, your brain searches everything else

#### Forgetting: Ebbinghaus
The founder of scientific research on memory

Studied nonsense syllables to investigate learning and forgetting
- Relearning task

#### Theories of Forgetting
- Motivated Forgetting
	- Forget information for a reason
	- traumatic event
- Encoding Failure
	- Do not fully encode info
- Retrieval failure
	- Memory in long-term memory are temporarily inaccessible

#### Decay vs. Interference
- Reasons why we may forget things
	- Decay
		- Info fades
		- Not influenced by other information
	- Interference
		- Other information disrupts learning
		- Proactive Interference
			- Older info interferes with the recall of new info
		- Retroactive
			- Newer info interferes with old info


#### Probe Digit Task
- Heard a list of 16 digits
	- 5214938164053276
- The last digit is a repeat (probe)
	- Probe is 6
- Have to remember number after probe
	- Answer is 4

#### Problems with Forgetting
- Source Amnesia
	- Don't know where it came from
	- Either your experience or another's
- Sleeper Effect
	- Don't remember where info came from
	- Someone in TikTok comment saying they're an "expert"
	- You don't believe them so you dismiss
	- Then you forget about the "expert" but remember what they said
	- Slowly, you begin to believe it yourself

#### Misinformation Effect
- Watch video of a car accident
- Answer questions about accident
	- Hit/Smashed/Collided/Bumped/Contacted
- One week later
	- Did you see broken glass?
	- If they heard the word "smashed" 24% more likely to say "yes I saw broken glass"

#### False Memories
- Given Descriptions of 4 events that happened in his life
	- 3 real events; 1 false event
- Asked to write down as many facts and details as he could remember about each event (or I don't know)
- The memories of the events became more detailed over time

#### Repressed Memories
Traumatic events are repressed to protect you. They can spontaneously resurface

#### Flashbulb Memories
- Flashbulb Memories are:
	- Vivid
	- Detailed
	- Long-Lasting
	- Memories we will "never forget"
	- Personally Meaningful
- Accuracy
	- Not any better than other memories
- Problems
	- Emotion
	- Interest
	- Rehearsal
	- Overconfidence

#### Memory Loss
- Retrograde Amnesia
	- Inability to remember information from one's past
- Anterograde amnesia
	- Inability to form new memories
	- Case of H.M.
		- Had a lobotomy and couldn't live on his own
