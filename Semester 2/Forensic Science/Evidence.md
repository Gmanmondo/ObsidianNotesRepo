# What is Evidence
- Supplies vital information on how and who committed a crime

**How do you decide what is approved?**

- The rules of evidence are used to determine whether something is admissible or inadmissible
	- Meant to screen out irrelevant or prohibited information
---
The rules of evidence are applied to determine the admissibility of **all information**
- Eyewitness testimony
- Photographs
- Physical Objects
- Scientifically generated information like DNA
If the information survives, it can be accepted as evidence of a material fact in trial.

# Admissibility of Evidence
- How do the courts decide whether information is admissible or not?
- A pre-requisite for admissibility is **a solid supportive foundation of any offer of evidence**
- There must be **enough information** to convince a judge that the proposed item of evidence **may in fact be true**

## Admissibility Hearings
Admissible evidence must be:
- Reliable
- Relevant to the case at hand
- For scientific analysis - the court must be assured that the methods used are **scientifically acceptable** and reliable

- Admissibility hearings provide a way for *new* scientific methods to be **introduced and accepted as viable tools in forensic science**
	- Can be held in the presentation of the case or separately
- The *standards* used by the courts can vary by jurisdiction, so we will simply go over the most important ones:
	- The Frye decision and Frye Standard
	- The Federal Rules of Evidence
	- The Daubert Decision
	- The Trilogy

# The Frye Standard
- 1920
- James Frye charged with 2nd degree murder
- Defense attempted to convince that Frye passed a lie detector test
- Just disallowed the testimony because the tech was too "new"
---

- Established the criteria known as: **general acceptance**
- To meet the Frye Standard, the court must decide whether the questioned **procedure, technique,** or **principle** is "generally accepted" by **a meaningful segment of the relevant scientific community.**

# Federal Rules of Evidence
- Rule 702 was a minor step forward from the Frye Standard
- "Testimony by Experts"
**Th evolution from generalists to specialists, makes 'general acceptance' more difficult to obtain. Rule 702 made it a little easier.**
- It did not
	- Specify a witness was to be qualified
	- What, specifically, the court should weigh in making that assessment

# Daubert Decision (1993)
- Daubert and Shuller's expert testimony **was disallowed for not using acceptance scientific methods**
	- Key component is falsifiability

![[Pasted image 20260123090003.png]]

# The Trilogy
## Daubert
- Established the judge as the gatekeeper
## Joiner
- Employee claimed chemicals he was exposed to at work gave him cancer
	- wanted to have animal studies submitted to support his case
- The court rejected these studies because they focused on **different chemicals and different exposure levels**
- Evidence must pas **the Daubert criteria** and **a relevance test**

## Kumho
- Civil case about the responsibility of the tire company in a fatality attributed to a tire failure
- One expert witness was an engineer, an the court ruled that the testimony offered by the engineer fell under the umbrella of scientific expert
**Kumho extended the Daubert ruling to**

# Categories of Evidence
## Inclusive
The evidence is included in the population of items that could have been the source

## Exclusive
The evidence is excluded from the population of items that could have been the source

## Direct
That which is known by personal knowledge, like eyewitness testimony.

## Circumstantial
Evidence that requires inference to move logically from the information provided to the answer in question
- Evidence must be tied to the suspect

## Reconstruction Evidence
Provides information about the events preceding's, occurring during , and occurring after commission of a crime.
- Logic
- Experience
- Observation
- Evaluate witness statements

### Associative
Associate or dissociate a suspect to a crime
### Exemplar
a sample of known origin used as a reference

## Class
Does not reference a particular suspect
- Has ability to narrow a field down to a group
	- Shoe size
	- hair color
	- height
	- sex
	- fingerprints (patterns)

## Individual Characteristic Evidence
Does associate a particular individual with the commission of a crime
- Has the ability to pin point a source
	- Fingerprints (minutia)
	- DNA

---
The type of evidence is important - but the **significance** of the evidence cannot be understated

---
# Eyewitness Testimony
- Eyewitness
- Hearsay witness
- Character witness
- Expert witness
## The Coppolinos
- William Farber and Carmela Coppolino's bodies were exhumed
- Dr. Carl Coppolino was tried in NJ for the death of William Farber and acquitted based on a lack of evidence for poisoning
- It was theorized during the trial that Dr. Coppolino exploited his access to potent drugs including succinylcholine chloride
	- New technique for detecting that drug was used to detect it in Carmela's brain
- This, and other evidence, was used to convict Dr. Carl of second-degree murder

## The Innocence Project
What is it?
- An organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted people through DNA testing and reforming the criminal justice system to prevent suture injustice.

## Wrongful Conviction
- Eyewitness misidentification
- Unreliable or improper forensic science
- False confections
- Government Misconduct
- Informants
- Bad lawyering
## Forensic Scientists
- Help ensure that the **guilty receive punishment** and the **innocent remain free**
- Practice good science
- Remain impartial
- Balance reason and emotion
- Educate
## The Expert Witness
- Trial courts have ==board discretion== in accepting an individual as an **expert witness** on any particular subject
- Must convince a judge you have an expertise in a subject ==either skill or knowledge==
- the court will usually consider:
- Knowledge acquired through experience
- Training
- Education

## Establishing Competency
- Critical to the qualification of a witness as an expert is establishing their ==ability== and ==competency pertaining to matter at hand==
- This is typically achieved when an expert witness is asked a ==series of questions before the court==
- Competency may be established via:
	- Cite degrees
	- Participation in special courses
	- Member of any professional societies
	- Professional articles/Books published
	- Number of years of experience

## Training as an Expert Witness
- Can train with an ==experienced expert witness==
- Independent study
- ==Formal education== in the physical sciences provides a firm foundation for learning and understanding the principles of forensic science
- Most importantly - the courts rely on BLANK

## The process in Court
- Even if you are deemed to be competent, the significance placed on the expert's testimony may greatly depend 
	- Experience
	- Demeanor
		- Were they clear, concise, and logical in their testimony

## Expert Witness vs Lay Witness Testimony
- An ordinary witness must testify on ==events or observations== That arise from personal knowledge
	- Must be ==factual==
	- Cannot contain ==personal opinions==

- An expert witness is explicitly brought in evaluate evidence when the court lacks the expertise to do so
	- Express their opinion as to the significance of the findings
	- Views are expressed solely on that opinion and can be accepted or ignored

## The Nature of Expert Testimony
- The expert witness render a view with ==absolute certainty==
- Can only offer an opinion based on ==reasonable scientific certainty== derived from training and expertise
- As an expert, you are expected to defend vigorously the techniques and conclusions of the analysis.
- Should be an ==Advocate of one party's cause
- It is the duty of the BLANK
