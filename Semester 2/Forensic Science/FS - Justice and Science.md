# What is Forensic Science
- Science used in legal investigations
	- Chemistry
	- Biology
	- Physics
	- Medicine
	- Pharmacology
	- Anthropology
	- Marine Science
	- Psychology

TV and Media have given unrealistic expectations of what CSI actually is

# Science and the Law Today

## Law: a way to settle disputes
Disputes between **Individuals and state** (Criminal Law)
Disputes between **individuals or entities** (Civil Law)

- Guided by the law, precedent, and functions using an **Adversarial system** (one side vs. another)
	- Up to a judge or jury to make final decision

## Science: A way to study the natural world
- Science enables us to ask basic questions
- Science helps us answer those questions using observation, testing and interpretations through logic
- A good Forensic scientist practices good science.

## Scientific Definitions
- **Hypothesis**: A tentative explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem that can be tested (Educated guess)

- **Scientific Theory**: Explanation of some aspect of the natural world that has been substantiated through repeated experiments or testing
	- can be supported, rejected or modified.

- **Fact**: 
	- A confirmed or agreed-upon empirical observation or conclusion.
	- Knowledge or information based of real occurrences

Referring to evolution as a scientific theory is incorrect, because it is a scientific fact.

## How Science Works
- Core logic of science
	- Test ideas with evidence
- Scientific method offers a framework for how to conduct research
	- presented like a recipe
	- Extreme oversimplification
- Science is NOT LINEAR
- Science is collaborative
	- Teamwork is key
- Creativity is important
- Science is never "over"

## The role of a Forensic Scientist
- Only concerned about the truth
- Only cares about the evidence
- Proper evidence collection
- Identifying the evidence
- Contamination issues
- Proper documentation
- Clear communication of ideas
