# Defining a crime scene
"==Any place== where a crime has been committed"
- Park
- Street
- Home
- Car

Many different ways to classify
- Location of original criminal activity
	- ==Primary scene==: The site of the original activity
	- ==Secondary scene==: any subsequent location
	- The classification scheme has nothing to do with a scene's relative importance
		- **Simply a sequence of locations**
- Size of crime scene
	- ![[Pasted image 20260206163911.png]]
	- Macroscopic
		- Overall crime scene
	- Microscopic
		- Smaller scenes -> trace evidence
- Other
	- Type of crime committed
		- Homicide
		- Robbery
		- Sexual Assault
	- Physical location of crime scene
		- indoors, outdoors, vehicles, etc.
	- Crime scene Condition
		- Damage to scene
		- General "state"
	- Type of Criminal Behaviour Associated with the Scene
		- Any patterns

## The importance of Physical Evidence (PE)
Three major avenues
- Confessions
- Eyewitness accounts
- Physical evidence
	- Free of inherent error or bias

![[Pasted image 20260206164341.png]]

## Activity - The Strength of class evidence
- Often lacks individual characteristics
- The likelihood of a suspect and victim being linked by physical evidence depends on the amount of evidence and their uniqueness

## The Product Rule and Probability
- The product rule states:
	- The probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone

**E.g.**
Case 1
- Blonde Hair (32%)
- Type O Blood (43%)
- Arch Fingerprints (5%)
==0.32 x 0.43 x 0.05
= 0.00688 x 100
= 0.688%==

# Crime Scene Investigation
- Recognize
- preserve
- Collect
- Interpret evidence

## Crime scene Procedures
Proper management of a crime scene is critical
The Lead investigator is often the ==most experienced== individual and is responsible for managing:
- ==information==
- ==technology==
- ==personnel==
- ==logistics==
Maintaining ==good communication== among all personnel is critical to a successful resolution to the investigation

## The First Responder
- The **First person** at the scene
- They are the only people to view a crime scene in its ==most original and pristine condition==
- Their actions at the scene can have ==far reaching== consequences
- They are the first step in linking a victim to a suspect
- Several important duties

### Their duties
- Assist victim and prevent changes to victim
- Search for and arrest the suspect if still there
- Detain any witnesses
	- ==Keep them separated to maintain objectivity==
	- ==Do not let them go back to the crime scene==
- Protect and secure the crime scene
	- ==Establish a perimeter==
	- ==Limit access to scene==
	- ==Prevent contamination==
- Document any and all changes to the crime scene

## Crime scene Survey
Preliminary scene survey is the first examination

Following guidelines should be followed:
- Use walk-through as a mental beginning for a reconstruction theory - be prepared to change your mind
- Note any evidence that needs immediate protection or processing
- Be aware of weather which could alter scene
- Note points of entry or exit
- Briefly record who, what, where, when, and how
- Assess what equipment and personnel is needed
- Notify superiors

==Transient evidence==
- Odour
- temperature
- imprints
==Condition evidence==
- Headlights on/off
- Radio on/off

# Crime Scene Documentation
- Single most important task
- Generating permanent record of ==the scene and its physical evidence==
- Most ==time consuming==
- Requires systematic and organized approach

## Note Taking
- 5 W's
	- who
	- what
	- where
	- when
	- why

![[Pasted image 20260206170610.png]]

## Videography
- Now a routine procedure
- virtual image of the scene
- **Should** be performed ==after== crime scene survey
- **Should not** include members of team or equipment
- **Should not** be narrated or include audio recording of subjective information

## Photography
- Provides ==true and accurate== pictorial record of crime scene and present physical evidence
- Performed ==immediately after== videography or preliminary search
	- ==Too many is better than too few==
- Must be recorded in a **photo log**
## Sketching
- Must obtain and record ==accurate measurements== of scene
- All previous tasks do not have any information about the objects actual size or measurement of scene and its physical evidence
- Provides ==proper perspective== of the scene and how the physical evidence ==relates to the scene==
- Two main types of sketches
	- Rough sketch
	- Final sketch
	- ![[Pasted image 20260206171307.png]]

# Crime Scene Searches
## Spiral Search
- Begin in middle and follow clockwise pattern
	- ![[Pasted image 20260206171516.png]]
- Advantages:
	- only one person required
	- Can also do an ‘inward spiral’ which goes from area light in evidence to area where evidence is likely found
	- Effective for small interior
- Disadvantages:
	- Hard to walk perfect spiral
	- Potential to miss evidence increases as the perimeter increases

## Strip Search
- ![[Pasted image 20260206171638.png]]
- Advantages:
	- Used for large outdoor scenes
	- When boundaries are well defined
- Disadvantages:
	- Area searched once, can miss evidence

## Grid Pattern
![[Pasted image 20260206171821.png]]
- Advantages:
	- Second pair of eyes searching
- Disadvantages:
	- Takes longer

## Zone Search
- Search area is broken down into zones and each zone is searched individually
- ![[Pasted image 20260206171912.png]]
- Advantages:
	- Useful in scenes that cover large area
	- Useful in complex scenes
- Disadvantages:
	- May vary depending on individual search method used within each zone

## Ray Search
- Search start at common point and walk away from each other
- ![[Pasted image 20260206172143.png]]
- Advantages:
	- Good for very large outdoor areas
- Disadvantages:
	- Not often used
	- Ineffective

# Collection and Preservation
- Evidence must be collected, packaged, marked, sealed, and preserved in a **consistent manner**
- Different types of evidence require different packing and collection techniques
- Transient, fragile, or easily lost evidence is given priority

- Evidence is packaged twice
	- Primary container
	- Secondary container

- Outer containers are completely sealed with tamper proof tape and marked with:
	- Date and time
	- When the item was collected
	- Location the item was found

- Liquids, volatiles, biological evidence requires special packaging
	- Airtight
	- Allowed to air dry before packaging
- Packaged separately to avoid cross contamination

## The Chain of Custody
- List of people who came in contact with the evidence
- An unbroken chain of custody must be established to get a piece of evidence presented in a court of law

# Pattern and Impression Evidence
## What are Fingerprints?
- The deposition of ==friction ridges
- Appear on palms, soles, and ends of fingers and toes
- Provide friction when grasping
- Features
	- Ridge: A single curved segment
	- Furrow: Region between two adjacent ridges
	- Pore: Found on ridges

	- Unique to individual
	- Don't change during lifetime

They are produced by:
- Deposition of ==sweat== by a finger ==contaminated by another material==
- Stamp of the ridge detail on the skin surface

## Visible Prints
- Made by fingers touching surface after contact with coloured materials
- Patent
	- Meaning obvious or evident - occur when fingers are contaminated with something
- Plastic
	- Made when a finger touches something soft and pliable

## Latent Prints
- Once the finger touches a surface, ==body oils== present on the finger ridges are transferred to that surface, leaving an impression
- Prints deposited in this manner are ==invisible to the naked eye==
- ==Friction ridge examination== is the preeminent method of individualization in forensic science

## How long do prints last?
- Plastic prints remain as long as the material is ==structurally intact==
- Prints left in a medium, such as blood or dust are ==fragile== and ==do not last long==
- Latent prints, in a proper environment, can ==last for years==
- ==Age of a print== is almost impossible to determine

## How well is a Fingerprint Formed?
- The surface which the print being made
- The pressure applied
- Time for which pressure is applied
	- Contact time is most important

# Classification of Fingerprints
![[Pasted image 20260206174903.png]]

## Minutiae
- Minutiae are used to individualize prints
- Individual ridge characteristics
	- 150 on average print
	- 8-16 matching minutiae are sufficient for an ID
![[Pasted image 20260206175101.png]]

## Unusual Fingerprints
- Skin Diseases
- Genetic Diseases
	- Naegeli Syndrome
	- Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR)
- Scars

# Fingerprint Enhancement
![[Pasted image 20260206175320.png]]

## Illumination Techniques
- Oblique lighting
- Expose fingerprint to UV or laser light
	- Oils and other foreign oils present in perspiration fluoresce when exposed to UV or laser light
	- Usually done after application of a dye

## Enhancement Techniques
- Increase contrast
- Colour or brightness
- Techniques work by adding a 'label' ==to some compounds found in a fingerprint==
- Can use a number of enhancement techniques is succession

### Powder dusting
- Simplest method
- Adherence of powder to create contrast with background

Brushes
- Applied with a soft fiberglass brush that has long fine bristles
- Do not make contact with surface

### Chemical Enhancement
- Method of ==visualizing prints== from recovered objects
	- Not conducted at a ==crime scene==
- Process involves exposing objects to fumes

# Fingerprint comparison
![[Pasted image 20260206180052.png]]
## Friction Ridge Analysis
- Friction ridges are studied for the kind, number, and location of various ridge characteristics or minutiae
	- Arrangement of characteristics create one-of-a-kind pattern
	- Careful point-by-point study determines if enough significant minutiae present
- Debate how many points of comparison are necessary and sufficient to reach a conclusion of identification
- Most agencies use a “no-point” standard
	- Threshold is one of a sufficient number of characteristics necessary to make a conclusion of identification, however many that might be
- ==Experience and judgement== are central to the process of a quality examination
- Majority of prints are identified, resolved and compared are ==partial prints==
- Prints may be ==unidentifiable== due to smudging, graininess, or size
- Depends upon scientist's:
	- Experience
	- Visual acuity
	- Judgement

## AFIS
- Automated Fingerprinting Identification System
- Since 1960’s
- Revolutionized law enforcement
- Applications:
	- Searching for a reference/inked prints
	- Searching for single prints
- It is an important and useful tool, as it places two images side by side and allows the examiner to chart the common features on both images simultaneously
