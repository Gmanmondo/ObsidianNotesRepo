![[Pasted image 20260206081804.png]]

## But Why?
Honourable Justice Campbell Report
- Paul Bernado, Sept. 1, 1995 (9 charges)
- " Problems turn out to be the same, the mistakes the same, and the systemic failures the same."
- "Motivation, investigative skill and dedication are not enough....require effective case management."

# What is a "Major Case?"
- Homicides
- Sexual Assaults
- Non-familial abductions
- Missing Person
- Found human remains
- Criminal harassment
- Any other case designated as a major case by the Major Case Management Executive Board

## Identification system
Process of early detection & linkages
Achieved through:
### Violent Crime Linkage Analysis Software (ViCLAS)
System used to compare crimes of violence through victimology, offender/suspect description and modus operandi
### Centre of Forensic Sciences (CFS)
Provide scientific laboratory services in support of the administration of justice and public safety
### Office of the Chief Coroner
Central repository of all death reports that have been investigated by all Coroners in Ontario
### DNA Data Bank
Repository of crime scene DNA
- Receives ~500-600 samples per week
- 253,345 DNA profiles of Convicted Offenders
- 220,258 DNA samples from Crime Scenes
### Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC)
Repository of charged, wanted, missing persons. Missing vehicles, property, and other crime related data.
### Major Case Management Software - PowerCase
Ministry approved - Major Case Management Software
- Centralized and secure data storage
- Evidence management
- Research
- Assign and track lines of investigation
- Intelligence analysis
- Court Preparation
### Serial Predatory Crime Investigator
Responsible for the review, development, and coordination of multi and single jurisdictional investigations of linked major cases
### Ontario Sex Offender Registry
Requires convicted sex offenders to provide current address and any address change
- Christopher's law

# Inter-disciplinary approach
- Forensic Identification Officers
- Forensic Pathology
- Forensic Odontology/dentistry

# Death
 - Cause of death
 - Manner of death
 - Mechanism of death

## Determination of time of death

| Rigor Mortis | Stiffening | 4hrs; 24-36hrs                |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Livor Mortis | Settling   | Minutes; 36hrs (fixed @12hrs) |
| Algor Mortis | Cooling    | Variable                      |
## Team Players
- Medical Examiner
- Coroner
- Forensic Pathologists
---
# Coroners
## Canadian Coroners
TWO SYSTEMS
- Jurisdiction of provincial/territorial government
- Coroner = Medical Examiner
- Do not determine civil or criminal responsibility

## Ontario Coroner
Coroners in Ontario are medical doctors with a specialization in death investigation
- Available to the community 24/7
- Report to the Chief Coroner
- Coroners investigate deaths under certain circumstances determined by the **Coroners Act of Ontario**

## Coroner vs Pathologist
### Coroner
- Oversee/governing body
- Determine cause of death
- Consider pathologist's report in determining cause or manner of death

### Pathologist
- Conducts autopsy
- Provides autopsy report to Coroner
- Specialized doctors


## Ontario Forensic Pathology Service
- Doctor Michael Pollanen, Chief Forensic Pathologist
- ~6000 autopsies/year

## The Investigation
Certification
- Identify
- Cause and Manner of Death
	- Manner
		- Natural
		- Accident
		- Suicide
		- Homicide
		- Undetermined
	- Cause
		- "Results in"
		- Temporal delay not relevant

# Autopsy
- Postmortem examination - A process whereby a pathologist or forensic pathologist examines the decedent's body
- Internal & External Investigation
