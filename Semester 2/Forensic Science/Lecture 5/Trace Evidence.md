# What is Trace Evidence
The evidence that is transferred is small or even microscopic size making analysis quite difficult. Making the microscope one of the most important tools

Locard's Exchange Principle tells us that:
- Every contact leaves a trace behind!

Primary Transfer:
- Direct contact from source

Secondary Transfer:
- Indirect contact
	- You pick up DNA from the person sitting there before you

# Microanalysis
The application of a microscope and microscopical techniques to the observation, collection, and analysis of micro-evidence that cannot be clearly observed or analyzed without such devices.
- Generally deals with samples in the ==Mg to mg==
- Often operate using different forms of energy:
	- visible light
	- UV
	- IF
	- electrons
- Can get useful information like:
	- Morphology: size, shape, etc.
	- Analytical data: optical properties

## Instruments of Microanalysis
- Many types of microscopes available for use in a forensic laboratory for a wide variety of materials, we will only discuss a few:
- Stereo microscope
- Compound binocular microscope
- Comparison microscope
- Basic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS)


If you probe matter with energy you can figure out useful information about it


### Stereo Binocular Microscope
- The most likely to be employed first in the examination of evidence
- Used in ==Preliminary examination== of submissions, and for the ==location== of microscopic particles and materials

- This microscope is of a ==compound type==
- Total magnification is computed by multiplier the power of the objective lens (OBJ) by that of the eyepiece lenses (EP)
	- ==Obj power x EP power = Tot magnification==
- The views are offset by 15° so that each eye sees a slightly different perspective
	- ==Results in 3D image==

### Compound Binocular Microscope
- Has ==2== eyepieces and only ==1== objective
	- ==25 -1200x== is possible
	- ==40 - 400x== commonly employed in forensics
- Mainly used to collect morphological information:
	- BLANK

### Comparison Microscopy
- At least one type will be present in every major crime laboratory
- Can simultaneously view two independent images in one field
	- Also allows superposition of the two images
- Classical, transmission illumination, and even PLMs can be oriented similarly
	- Critical for ==side-by-side comparison== of evidence
- Many experts suggest this is: ==The only=== BLANK


### Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
- Enables for greater magnification (10- 100,00x)
- Principle of operation:
	- Beam of electrons is swept over a small spot
	- Beam of electrons interacts with surface, and area slightly below the surface of the sample
	- Initial beam of electrons removes additional electrons from the sample, which are converted to an image
	- X-rays are also created, which can be measured with an energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS) to obtain chemical information

# Microscopic Evidence and its Analysis
## Glass Fragments
Common type of microscopic evidence, frequently encountered as transfer evidence

- Broken and shattered fragments can place a suspect at a crime
- Chips of broken glass from a window may lodge in a suspect's shoes or garments
- Particles of headlight glass found at the scene of a hit-and-run can lead to clues about the identity of a suspect vehicle

## What is Glass?
- It is an amorphous solid
	- Hard, brittle material that is usually transparent and lacks ordered arrangement of atoms found in most solid

## Forensic Analysis of Glass
- Comparing glass consists of:
	- Finding and measuring the properties that will associate one glass fragment with another
	- Minimizing or eliminating the possible existence of other sources

## Individualization of glass
- Due to the ubiquity of glass, analysis can be challenging
- Glass possesses it greatest evidential value when it can be ==individualized to one source== (Class evidence)
	- This can only truly be done when two pieces of glass can be physically matched together
- Individualization comparisons require"
	- Piecing together ==irregular edges==
	- Matching all ==irregularities and striations== on broken surfaces

## Comparing Glass Fragments
- Can vary in terms of composition ==(physical, optical and elemental)==
- Due to mass production, many types of glass do not possess any characteristics that can be used for individualization
	- Small pieces of glass are considered to be class evidence

### Density
Density is defined as the mass per unit volume 
- Density is an **intensive property** of matter, meaning it remains regardless of sample size
- It is considered a characteristic property of a substance and can be used as an aid in identification

### Refractive index
Light changes speed depending on the medium it passes through
- Refractive index is the ratio of the velocity of light in a vacuum to that in the medium under examination

### Flotation Method
- The flotation method is a rather precise and rapid method for comparing ==glass densities==

Steps:
- Put glass of interest into beaker of liquid
- Glass might either float or sink
- Then you know the density of the glass
- If it does not float for example like our glass of interest, the it is not the same as our glass of interest
- Then adjust density of solution to make glass of interest sink

### Glass immersion Method
- Method used to identify **Refractive index**
- Makes use of the Becke Line:
	- A bright halo near the border of a particle that is immersed in a liquid of a different refractive index
- In the immersion method:
	- A glass particle is immersed in a liquid
	- The liquid's refractive index is varied until it is equal to that of the glass particle
	- When the refractive index of the particle and the liquid match, known as the match point, the Becke line disappears
	- Minimum contract is observed between liquid and particle

### Order of Impact
- Radial cracks: ==Originate from impact point and propagate out==
- Concentric cracks: ==Circle around impact point==
- Terminated cracks: =='T' junctions; caused by later cracks==

### Direction of Impact - Radial Crack
- When glass breaks, edge characteristics known as conchoidal lines often develop
- They will meet one edge of the glass ==at 90 degrees==
- For radial cracks, this is the opposite surface from which the force originated
- Was it an "inside job"

## Glass Analysis Summary
- The ultimate goal of forensic analysis is individualization of the evidence
- Individualization is often only possible with a physical match
- Due to the ubiquity of glass it is largely considered to be class evidence
	- Flotation method is used to measure **density**
	- Glass immersion method is used to measure is used to measure **refractive index**

- Other important pieces of information obtainable through the analysis of glass are:
	- Order of impact
	- Direction of impact

# Hairs and Fibers
- Refractive index is the ratio of the velocity of light in a vacuum to that in the medium under examination
- Individualization of a human hair is ==not possible through its morphology alone==
	- Isolation and characterization of DNA is possible
- Hair can provide ==strong corroborative evidence== for placing an individual of a crime scene
- Requires:
	- Requires properly collected and submitted samples
	- Adequate number of standard/reference samples

## Morphology
- Hair is an ==appendage of the skin== that grows out of an organ known as the ==hair follicle==
- The length of a hair extends from its root or bulb embedded in the follicle, continues into a shaft, and terminates at a tip end.
- BLANK

## Cuticle
- The cuticle is the scale structure covering ==the exterior of the hair
	- The scales always point towards the ==tip of the hair==
	- The scale pattern is useful in ==identifying the animal of origin==


## Cortex
Main body of hair shaft
- Its major forensic importance is the fact that it is embedded with the pigment granules that impart hair with color
- BLANK

## Medulla
The medulla is a cellular column running through the center of the hair\
![[Pasted image 20260213100414.png]]

- Less than one-third of the diameter of the shaft
- animals are one half or greater
- Can be **continuous, interrupted, fragmented**, or absent

## Root
- The root and other surrounding cells in the hair follicle provide the tools necessary to ==produce hair and continue its growth==
- The three phases of hair growth are the anagen, catagen, and telogen phases
- When pulled from the head, some translucent tissue surrounding the hair’s shaft near the root may be found.
- By using ==DNA analysis== on the follicular tag, the hair may be ==individualized==

## Comparison of Hairs
- The ==comparison microscope== is an important tool for comparing the ==morphological characteristics== of hair.
- Particularly important in distinguishing animal from human hair are:
	- scale structure, medullar index
	- BLANK
- Other important features for comparing human hair are:
	- The presence or absence of a medulla
	- The distribution, shape, and color intensity of the pigment granules present in the cortex
- The most common request is to determine whether or not hair recovered at the crime scene compares to hair removed from the suspect
	- Microscopic hair examinations are ==highly subjective==
	- Depend on ==skill + integrity==
	- A report of hair comparison BLANK

## Types of Fibers
Natural fibers are derived in whole from animal or plant sources
- Wool
- Mohair
- Cashmere
- Furs
- Cotton
- Hemp
Man made fibers
- Regenerated fibers are made from natural materials
	- rayon
	- acetate
- Synthetic fibres are made from chemicals
	- nylons
	- polyesters'
	- acrylics
Synthetic fibers are composed of polymers, or macromolecules, which are a large number of atoms arranged in repeating units known as monomers

## Fiber Evidence
Quality of fiber evidence depends on:
- The ability to ==identify the origin of the fiber
- To be able to ==narrow the possibilities== to a limited number of sources

Determining a common origin is the goal:
- The strongest evidence that two different fabrics were of common origin:
	- ==Two torn edges that can be fit together==
- Microscopic comparisons are performed initially
	- Between questioned and standard/reference fibers
	- Evaluated for ==colour + diameter==
	- Using a ==comparison microscope==

- Morphological features that could be important in comparing fibers are:
	- The cross section
	- Lengthwise striations of the surface of the fiber
	- The presence of delustering particles that reduce shine
![[Pasted image 20260213102008.png]]

## Methods for Fiber Comparison
Identification of generic fiber class can be accomplished using infrared spectrophotometry
- The molecules that compose a manufactured fiber selectively absorb infrared light to form a characteristic pattern

The microspectrophotometer allows a forensic analyst to view an object under a microscope while simultaneously obtaining its visible of infrared absorption pattern
- Input of visible light or infrared light to compare the colors of fibers through spectral patterns
