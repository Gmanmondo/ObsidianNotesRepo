## [[Lecture 2]] Recap:

-  Analogue: Inspiration that is pulled from the real world
- Story Seed: Something to start from, it grows and branches off into new ideas.

# World Building
Worldbuilding is the building of the games setting.

- It's easier to name a brad place like "The Mind" or a "Fantasy Kingdom"
- It's much tougher to get into the details.

The world informs the player on everything from narrative to gameplay. (Build a world in which your plot makes sense)

Your world and mechanics are often intertwined.

The world creates conditions in which your mechanics make sense.


## How Do I Build a World?
Ask yourself:
- **Who** exists in this world?
- **What** is happening?
- **Where** does the player-character go in the world?
- **When** does this take place in that world's history?
- **Why** is this world the right one for the game?
- **How** does the world work? How does it feel? How do the inhabitants feel about each other?

### Two Key Approaches
### **The Macro Level**: Start BIG and broad
- Top down approach, broad concepts
- Theme or Genre
- Could be as broad as "The costs of war"
- **Macro does not mean vague!** It means big picture
- You still need to add detail

### **The Micro Level**: Starting Small and specific
- Starts small and expands upward
- Beginning might be a single event or action
- One detailed image or idea gets you started
- E.g.: Narnia started from the image of a faun standing under a lamp-post
- Could be a character, line of dialogue, core mechanic.
- You build outward from a single point and make the world that makes it possible.

## Iceberg Model
There's a lot that goes unseen by your player

**However**, Your team on the other hand needs to be able to see under the water and have a full picture of your world to make it *cohesive*. ==You need to know your world very well==

# Mechanics & Narrative
Best to make the story or narrative function well with the mechanics
(Deep intense cutscene - turns to Candy Crush like gameplay)

## Reminder
- Broadly defined, mechanics are the structures that define the game
- "Core Mechanics" are the key actions that make-up the core gameplay loop

## Core Mechanics and Story
Tremblay:
- **Literal**: All mechanics imply information about the world of the game or its characters
- **Thematic**: All mechanics have associated feelings

Feelings experienced during gameplay loop is a kind of emotional story even if the game is abstract. If it's not abstract, there are even more literal narrative implications as a result.

> A world in which you fight with guns is very different from a world where you fight with knives... Which in turn is very different from a world in which monkeys fight with knives.
