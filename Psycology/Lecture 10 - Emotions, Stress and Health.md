# Brain Mechanism
## Amygdala

- Alerts the brain when reaction is necessary

- Evidence
	- Damage to the amygdala
		- Psychic blindness

## Prefrontal Cortex
- Full conscious experience of emotions
- Deliberate and planned behaviours
- Receives input from
	- The amygdala
	- the somatosensory cortex
- Evidence
	- Prefrontal lobotomies
	- Neural activity
