# Neurons
- 100 billion in the brain at birth

**3 main sections MUST KNOW**
![[Pasted image 20250922145311.png]]

### Section 1 - Dendrites
Receive information from either a neuron nervous system
Goes into the Soma - Cell body
### Section 2 - Axon
Pass on information at 300Km/s
Covered in a fatty sheet called the **Myelin Sheath**
### Section 3 - Axon Terminal
Message leaves neuron to go to next neuron

## Neural Communication
- Fluid inside and outside of neurons
	- contain electrically charged ions

- Resting potential: have a negative charge of -70mV (Neuron at rest)
	- Sudden reversal in charge (Depolarization to +40 mV)

- Stimulation causes cell membrane to open briefly
	- Positively charged sodium ions flow in
	- Shift in electrical charge travels along the neuron

**Synapse**: Space between neurons
- Chemical exchange of information
- Chemical messengers that cross the synapse and bind to the receptor sites on the receiving neurons (On the Dendrites)
	- Excitatory
		- Cause depolarizations
		- Cause inflow of sodium or other (+ ions)
	- Inhibitory
		- Cause Hyperpolarization
		- (+ ions) flow out and (- ions) flow in

## Neurotransmitters
- Monoamines
	- Regulate emotions, learning, and movement
	- Dopamine: Happy drug
		- Too much: Schizophrenia
		- Too little: Parkinson's Disease
	- Norepinephrine: Arousal
		- Too little: Depression
	- Serotonin
		- SSRI: Keeps serotonin in the brain for longer
		- Too little: Depression
	- Acetylcholine (Ach)
		- Neuromuscular transmitter
		- Implicated in muscle movement, learning, and memory
			- Alzheimer's Disease
	- GABBA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)
		- Inhibitory transmitter
		- Related to emotion and arousal
			- Anxiety
	- Endorphins
		- Regulate eating and drinking
		- Modulate pain and pleasure
			- opiates

# The Nervous System
## Central
Spinal Cord
- 40-45cm
- Transmits info t=between brain and peripheral nervous system
- Handles simple reflexes

Brain
- 3lbs of protein, fat and fluid
- 2% of total body weight
- consumes 20% of oxygen

## Peripheral
- Sensory and motor neuron connecting to central nervous system to the rest of the body
### Somatic
**Voluntary control of skeletal muscles**

**Sensory Neurons:** Carry info from tissues and senses to central system
**Motor Neurons:** Carry outgoing info from central system to muscles
**Interneurons:** Sensory-motor relay within the central system
### Autonomic
Controls Glands and muscles of internal organs
- Heart Beat
- Digestions
#### Sympathetic
- Fight or flight
- Prepare for action
- increase heart rate
- inhibit activities that do not help during fight or flight (like digestion)
#### Parasympathetic
- Pretty much opposite to sympathetic
- Rest and Digest
	- Slows heartbeat
	- Stimulates digestion
	- Gallbladder for bile release

# The Brain
## Neuropsychological Tests
- measures of verbal and non-verbal behaviour that assess psychological functioning
	- Motor functions
	- Sensory functions
	- Memory
	- Language

## Stimulation Techniques
- Specific regions of the brain stimulated with electrical pulses
	- Open brain surgery
	- Poking around and mapping it out

## Destruction Techniques
- Investigate the behavioural effects caused by damage to the brain
- Intentionally destroying part of the brain to see what happens
	- Mice, animals, etc.

## Electroencephalogram
- Electrical Recordings using a cap
- Looking for abnormal recordings
---
## Brain Imaging
### CAT (Computerized Axial Tomography)
X-rays of narrow slices of the brain
Structure of the brain
### PET (Positron Emission Tomography)
- Visual display of brain activity using amount of glucose
- Radioactive isotopes placed in blood
- Sensors detect radioactivity
- Different tasks show different activity
### MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
- A brain-imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produces 3D images
- Amount of chemicals active in the tissue
- taken minutes apart

### FMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
- Focused on blood flow
- images taken seconds apart

## Divisions of the Brain
### Hindbrain
- **Brainstem**
	- Medulla
		- Heartbeat
		- Breathing
		- Contralateral control
	- Pons
		- Sends sensory info between cerebrum and cerebellum
		- Assists in autonomic functions
		- Affects arousal
	
- **Cerebellum**
	- Attached to brainstem
	- Muscular Motor co-ordination
		- Processing sensory input
		- Nonverbal learning and memory
		- Fast, Reflexive, involuntary movements
		- Balance
### Midbrain
- Reticular Formation
	- Nerve Network extending from spinal cord through the thalamus
	- Filters info
	- Controls arousal

- Limbic System
	- Hypothalamus
		- Autonomic Nervous system (Regulate body functions)
		- Regulates homeostasis
			- Hunger, thirst, temperature
		- "Reward Centres"
	- Amygdala
		- Emotion
			- Fear, aggression
	- Hippocampus
		- Memory formation
		- Spatial orientation

 

### Forebrain
#### Thalamus
- Brain's switchboard
- Processes Neural rhythms
	- Sleep/awake cycle
- Role in higher-order conditions
	- creativity, symbolism, thought

#### Cerebral Cortex
##### Occipital lobes
- Input from eyes via optic nerve
- Contains primary visual cortex
- outputs to parietal and temporal lobes
##### Temporal Lobes
- Input from ears and occipital lobes
- Recognition and memory
- Outputs to limbic system, basal ganglia, and brainstem
##### Parietal Lobes
- Multiple sensory inputs
- Outputs to frontal lobes
- Sensorimotor control
##### Frontal Lobes
- No direct sensory input
- Planning and judgement
- Motor cortex
- Includes motor speech area
	- Broca's area
##### Association Areas
- Higher-order mental functions
- Cannot be neatly mapped
- Found in all lobes
	- Prefrontal cortex (Seat of executive functions)

## Hemispheric Lateralization
- Refers to the relatively greater specialization of function in one hemisphere or the other 
**Left**
- Positive emotion
- Words
- Logic
- Lists
- Numbers
- Sequence
- Analysis
**Right**
- Negative emotions
- Size
- Wholeness
- Rhythm
- Imagination

### Bridging the Gap
**Corpus Callosum**
- Mass of Neurons that connect the left and right Hemispheres
	- Allows communication between hemispheres
### Split-Brain Research
- Severing the Corpus Callosum was used to treat severe seizure patients

### Neuroplasticity
- The brain's ability to recognize and change its structure and function throughout the lifespan
- Greater plasticity early in life
- As we age...
	- Unused connection die off
	- Plasticity decreases but does not vanish
		- recovery after brain damage
		- Transplanting neural tissue
