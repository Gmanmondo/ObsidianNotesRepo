# Story
## Where did it come from

| Philosophy                                 | Natural Science                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ideas about how knowledge can be acquired. | Progress on understanding the nervous system, senses, etc. |
The idea of applying the methods of science to the study of human behavior -- **Modern Psychology**

- **Empiricists** knowledge is observed
- **Nativists** Knowledge is native, implicit

## Philosophers
- **Aristotle**: Empiricism is born
	- Knowledge is gained through experience
- Environment and upbringing change cognitive abilities


- **John Locke**: Nothing can exist within the intellect that did not have its origin in the senses

---


## Scientists
- **Charles Darwin**
	- Natural Selection
	- Nothing special about humans


- **Ivan Sechenov**
	- Physiologist
	- All complex behaviour can be explained by reflexes


---

## Early Psychology
- **Wilhelm Wundt**
	- First psychology lab
	- Founder of structuralism
	- Introspection

## North America
- **William James**
	- Functionalism
	- All about Function (Why the nose smells)
	
- **John Watson**
	- Rise of Behaviourism
	- The study of **objective** observable and measurable outcomes and behaviours
	- Much more research done on animals, mice, primates, dogs, etc.
	
- **Wolfgang Kohler**
	- Gestalt Psychology
	- The whole > the sum of its parts
	- Problematic to look at things in isolation
- **Sigmund Freud**
	- Austrian Physician who focused on mental disorders
	- Psychoanalytic theory of mental disorders
		- The importance of the unconscious
		- Impact of unresolved past conflicts


# What do we Notice?
These are all **WHITE MEN**

Only one woman (Elanor Gibson) in the research team above and no people of colour
The people who attended these studies were typically:
- Western
- Educated
- Industrialised
- Rich
- Democratic

They generalized from a small pool of people based on the group that they studied and applied it to the whole world

## Three major changes since then
![[Pasted image 20250922105409.png]]
- **Cognitive Revolution**
- **Social Influence**
	- WW2
		- Obedience (Ex Nazis would say in interrogations would say "I was just following orders")
	
	- Desegregation
		- Especially in the US
	
	- Multiculturalism
		- We still suck at having a large multicultural research pool
	
- **Biopsychosocial approach**

# What do we actually study in Psychology?
In the US psychological department there are 56 different divisions. Professor Leach is in 41.

## Where do Psychologists work?
### Experimental Psychologists
- Universities and Colleges
- Industry

### Clinical Psychologists
- Universities and colleges
- Industry
- Private Practice
- Clinic and Hospital

---

### Psychiatry vs Psychology
#### Psychiatrists
- M.D.
- Plus training in treatment of psychological disorders
- May prescribe medication

#### Psychologists
- Ph.D.
- May not prescribe medication
- Counseling vs. Clinical Psychologists

# The Science of Psychology

## The Need for Psychological Science
- Humans can't rely solely on common sense and intuition
- Sources of intuition overestimation
	- Hindsight bias
	- Overconfidence
	- Tendency to perceive patterns in random events
		- Conspiracy theories
Just think about how people are over-confident in comment sections

## The Goals of Psychology
- Describe
	- What behaviour has occurred
- Explain
	- Why that behaviour has occurred
- Predict
	- When and where that behaviour is going to occur
- Change
	- How to prevent or bring about desired goals


## The Scientific Method
![[Pasted image 20250922111600.png]]
You need **Critical Thinking**

We never "Accept" a hypothesis. We either reject it, or fail to reject it at this time. You never want to be complicit with your answers. Try to prove yourself wrong


## Important Terms
- **Theory**: Explanation using an integrated set of principles that organizes observations and predicts behaviours or events

- **Hypothesis**: Testable prediction, often implied by a theory

- **Operational Definition**: Carefully worded statement of the exact procedures used in a study

- **Replication**: Repeating the essence of a research study to see whether the basic finding can be reproduced

---

## Ethics - Humans
Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical conduct for research involving humans

- **Informed Consent**: Giving potential participants enough information about the study to inform them to enable to chose to participate or not

- **Confidentiality**: Information is kept private

- **Debriefing**: Post-experimental explanation of a study, including its purpose and any deception, to its participants.


## Ethics - Animals

- **Animal Welfare**: Minimization of pain, stress, and humane treatment.

- **Animal Rights**?
	- Cannot consent

---

## Types of Research
- Basic
	- Pure science that aims to increase scientific knowledge base
- Applied Research
	- Scientific study that aims to solve practical problems

---

## Research Settings
- Laboratory Research
	- Research conduct in a regulated environment where participants can be carefully observed
- Field Research
	- Research that is conducted in real-world locations


---
## Research Designs
- Descriptive
	- Describing evets
	- **Case studies** - Studying one individual or a group in depth in the hope of revealing universal principles
	- **Naturalistic Observation** - Observing and recording behaviour in natural situations (Going to the park and observing the children)
	- **Surveys and Interviews** - Obtaining self-reported attitudes or behaviours of a group
		- Random Sample - A random selection of people that provides equal chance of inclusion
		- Types of questions - Closed-ended questions, Open-ended questions
		- Problems with Self-report
			- Small changes in the order of questions can affect responses
			- People do not always know the answer
			- People aren't always honest

- Correlation
	- Finding relationships
	- Measures the extent to which two factors vary together and, thus of how well either factor predicts the other
	- Correlational Coefficient: Statistical direction of the relationship between two things **(-1 to +1. 0 is no relationship)**![[Pasted image 20250922120056.png]]
	- Illusory Correlation
		- Perceiving a relationship where none exists or perceiving a stronger-than-actual relationship (Lucky Pencil)
	- Regression toward the mean
		- Tendency for extreme or unusual scores or events to fall back down toward the average. (Doing really well on one exam then the next is mid)
	- Correlation and Causation ![[Pasted image 20250922121044.png]]
	- Correlation doesn't always mean causation
		- Could be a third factor that affects both
#### Going to be on Exam!
	- **Sign indicates direction of relationship**
	- **Number indicates strength of relationship** 

- Experimental
	- Cause and effect
	- Involves the manipulation of one or more factors **(Independent Variable)** to observe the effect on behaviour or mental processes **(Dependant variables)** By **Random assignment** of participants the experimenter aims to control other relevant variables that might change the research outcome.
	- Independent variables have at least 2 groups
		- Control group
		- Experimental group
	
	- Experimental Safeguards
		- Bias
			- Double blind procedure
			- Placebos
		- Sample Bias
			- Random Sampling
			- Random Assignment

### Problems with experiments
- Findings might not generalize to other contexts
- Not always feasible
- Not always ethical

## Statistical Reasoning
- Accurate statistical understanding is important
- Casual estimates often misinformation

## Measures of Central Tendency
- Mode: Most frequently occurring score
- Mean: Average of a distribution
- Median: Middle Score of a distribution

## Measures of Variation
- Range: Difference between the highest and lowest scores in a distribution
- Standard Deviation: Computed measure of how much scores vary around the mean score
	- Compare to normal curve

## Interpreting Data
- Statistical Significance:
	- How likely to get that score by chance. Assuming there is no difference in populations being studied
- Reliability:
	- Representative samples
	- Bigger Samples
	- More Estimates
		- Meta Analysis
