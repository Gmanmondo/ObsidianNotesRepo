# What is Learning?
- The process of acquiring through experience new and relatively enduring information and behaviours.
	- Adapting to unchanging and repeated stimuli

## Evolution vs. Learning
**Evolution**
- Changes made over generations (stored in genes)

**Learning**
- Changes over a lifetime (Stored in Central Nervous System)

## The Behaviourists
- Must study the observable behaviour
- Knowledge is learned
- Less likely to focus on perception and sensation
- Tested on animals (Because there's "Nothing special about humans")

# Conditioning
## Classical Conditioning
- Pavlov
- Learning by associating environmental stimuli and behavioural responses
- Learning occurs when you recognize that one event predicts another.

- The dogs would salivate when his associate would enter the room
	- It's because he was the one who fed them

The reliability of the pairing that matters. any input of stimuli can have any trained response

Focuses on those autonomic responses

### Before Conditioning

| Stimuli              | Response                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Meat (Unconditioned) | Salivation (Unconditioned) |
| Tone (Neutral)       | No salivation              |
### During Learning
Repeatedly pair Unconditioned Stimulus with Neutral Stimulus

| Stimuli     | Response                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Meat + Tone | Salivation (To the meat) |
### After Learning
| Stimuli            | Response                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Tone (Conditioned) | Salivation (Conditioned) |

### Timing is Important
#### Forward Conditioning

| Delayed Conditioning                                                              | Trace Conditioning                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| The light is turned on slightly before the shock, and turned off mid way through. | The light is turned on then off before the shock |

#### Simultaneous Conditioning
The light and the shock happen at the same time![[Pasted image 20251107141721.png]]

#### Backward Conditioning
Shock goes on and off before the light does![[Pasted image 20251107141750.png]]

### The Terminology Game
*What you're looking for: **Conditioned Response, Unconditioned Stimulus, Conditioned Stimulus***

**Every time Robert's wife flushes the toilet when he's in the shower, the water becomes painfully hot. One day, as Robert is stepping into the shower, he hears a flushing sound and flinches.**

- The flinch in the **Conditioned Response**
- The hot water is the **Unconditioned Stimulus**
- The flush is the **Conditioned Stimulus**

**Sara has had a lot of dental work done recently (fillings, root canals). Now, just walking into the reception room at the dentist makes her palms sweaty.**

- The sweaty palms is the **Conditioned Response**
- The dental office is the **Unconditioned Stimulus**
- The reception room is the **Conditioned Stimulus**

**Michael's first girlfriend loved to eat onions. Whenever they kissed, he could faintly taste onion on her breath. Now, the taste of onions "turns him on."**

- Being turned on is the **Conditioned Response**
- The kissing is the **Unconditioned Stimulus**
- The onion is the **Conditioned Stimulus**

### Other Important Terms
- Acquisition
	- Learning of the classically conditioned stimulus-response relationship

- Extinction
	- Gradually diminishing of a conditioned response

- Spontaneous Recovery
	- Reappearance, after a pause, of a weakened conditioned response.
![[Pasted image 20251107144836.png]]

- Stimulus Generalization
	- Conditioned response to stimuli that ate similar to the original stimulus
	- Bee/wasp

- Stimulus Discrimination
	- Learned ability to respond differently to stimuli that differ from the conditioned stimulus on some dimension
	- ![[Pasted image 20251107145200.png]]

### Higher Order Conditioning
- A neutral stimulus is linked to a CS
- This becomes a new CS
- One CS is used to create another CS![[Pasted image 20251107145428.png]]

### Learning Phobias
- John B. Watson
- Applied classical conditioning to humans
- (Learned to fear the rat by banging a metal bar really loudly to a 11 month old) Allegedly it worked but t'was sketchy![[Pasted image 20251107145626.png]]

### Behavioural Therapy
Inspiration from Classical Conditioning
- Systematic Desensitization
	- Slowly replacing the anxiety with relaxation

- Aversive Conditioning
	- E.G: The images on cigarette packages to discourage smoking
---
### Other Considerations
- Preparedness
	- Biological predispositions to learn associations that have survival value

- Taste Aversions
	- Classically conditioned negative reactions to a particular taste that have been associated with illness

- Role of Cognition
	- Expectations

## Operant Conditioning
Aka "Instrumental Conditioning" or "Skinnerian Conditioning"

- Leaning by associating a voluntary behaviour with its consequences
- Learning occurs when you recognize that one event predicts another
- Law of Effect
	- Responses followed by positive outcomes were more likely to be repeated and vise versa

### Shaping Behaviour
- If the desired behaviour is not being exhibited, the experimenter can reward the tester for getting closer to the behaviour they were expecting to begin with.
- Rewarding successive approximations

### Terms
- Reinforcement
	- An event that strengthens the behaviour it follows
	- positive or negative (Ether removing or adding something positive or negative to the event)
	- Primary vs. conditioned (secondary) 
- Punishment
	- To decrease the behaviour
	- Positive or negative (Ether removing or adding something positive or negative to the event)
	- Primary vs. conditioned (secondary) (Primary is for survival and secondary is something that you've *learned* to like)

### Practice
*Is it positive/negative reinforcement/punishment?*


| Will it make you do it more? | Is something being given or taken away? |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Reinforcement/Punishment     | Positive/Negative                       |


**If you get caught drunk driving, you will lose your license**
- Negative punishment

**A child is allowed to watch TV if he finishes his homework**
- Positive reinforcement

**If you get out of bed, your roommate will stop yelling at you to get up**
- Negative reinforcement

**A police officer gives a speeding motorist a ticket**
- Positive punishment


### Partial Reinforcement
- Fixed Ratio
	-  Reinforced after fixed number of responses

- Variable Ratio
	- Reinforced after a variable number of responses

- Fixed Interval
	- Reinforced after a given amount of time has elapsed

- Variable Interval
	- Reinforced after a variable interval of time has elapsed

### Name That Schedule
**You get 1 air mule for every $20 you spend**


### Behavioural Therapy
Inspiration from Operant Conditioning
- Behaviour modification Therapy
	- Using positive reinforcement to change behaviour

- Token Economies
	- Desired behaviours are positively reinforced with tokens
	- Can be exchanged for tangible reward

### Other Considerations
- Role of Cognition
	- Learned helplessness
	- Beliefs about reinforcements
	- Contrast effects (positive vs. negative)
	- Self-evaluations

- Biological Constraints
	- Can't learn some behaviours
	- Can't unlearn others

## Classical vs. Operant
### Classical
- Delivery is controlled by the experimenter
- Responses are involuntary

### Operant
- Delivery is controlled by the participant
- Responses are voluntary

## Cognitive Maps
- Train rats with all alleys open
- If "block A" in place, choose green path
- If "block B" in place, chose blue path
- Rats took the shortest detours![[Pasted image 20251107155933.png]]

## Latent Learning
- Hidden learning that exists without behavioural signs

## Observational Learning
Learning by observing others

- Cognitive Process
	- Attention
	- Retention
	- Reproduction
	- Motivation
