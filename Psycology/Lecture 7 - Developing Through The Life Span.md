# Developmental Psychology
Study of physical, cognitive, and social change throughout the life span

Central Questions
- Continuity
- Sources of development (Nature/Nurture)
- Plasticity
- Individual differences
- Active/Passive

# Research Strategies
- Cross-Sectional Study
	- Compares people of different ages at the same point in time
		- Advantages:
			- Fast
		- Disadvantages:
			- Cohort effect
			- Got to make sure your cohort is representative of all other cohorts

- Longitudinal Study
	- Follows the same people over time
		- Advantages:
			- Can observe the same people over the course of the development period
		- Disadvantages:
			- Practice effect. They just know how to do well on the tests
			- Nobody wants to do it anymore
			- Cross-generational difference

# Prenatal Development
## Conception
Sperm enters the egg and create a zygote

Three periods
- Germinal Period
	- 0-10 days
	- The Zygote
- Embryonic Period
	- 3-8 weeks
	- Embryo
	- Development of vital organs
	- Most vulnerable period
- Fetal Period
	- 8-38 weeks
	- Organs begin to function
	- Fetus
	- Axons and Dendrites begin to form connections
	- Hindbrain -> Midbrain -> Forebrain

### Teratogens
Agents that can reach the embryo or fetus during parental development and cause harm

# Physical Development
## Infancy
![[Pasted image 20251107192721.png]]

## Adolescence
- Begins at puberty
	- Development of sex characteristics
		- primary = reproductive
		- secondary = non-reproductive

- Main Landmarks
	- Women: menarche
	- Men: Production of sperm

## Adulthood
- Live Span
	- The maximum age possible for members of a given species
		- Cellular-clock theory
			- Hayflick Limit: Telomeres at the end of the DNA shorten after every multiplication
		- Wear-and-tear theory: The cells are damaged over time

- Life Expectancy
	- The number of years the average member of a species is expected to live

## Sensory Abilities
As you age, you begin to lose your senses, hearing, sight, smell.
- Mom is losing her hearing

# Cognitive Development
## Jean Piaget
- Schema
	- A concept or framework that organizes and interprets information
- Assimilation
	- The process of processing info based on the schemas
- Accommodation
	- Modifying existing schemas in response to new info

## Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory
Sensorimotor Stage (0-2 years)
- Object permanence
- Relies on senses and motor skills to navigate their environment

Preoperational Stage (2-6 years)
- Egocentrism
	- Inability to take perspective of another person
- ![[Pasted image 20251107195213.png]]
- Theory of Mind
	- People's ideas about their own and others' mental states
- The Smarties Test
	- Smarties box with pencils inside
	- Child discovers pencils
	- Is asked what someone who hasn't seen what's inside would think is inside the box
	- If the child answers pencils they fail
	- If they answer smarties they lose

Concrete Operational Stage (6-12 years)
- Conservation
	- Object's properties remain the same despite change
	- E.g., Size changes with distance

Formal Operational Stage (12-adult)
- Hypothetical-Deductive Reasoning
	- Premises
		- All poodles are dogs
		- All dogs are animals
	- Conclusion
		- All poodles are animals

## Aging and Intellectual Functions
- Memory and Forgetting
	- Cognitive abilities do not inevitably decline


# Social-Emotional Development
## Parenting Styles

| PARENTING TRAITS   | High Responsiveness | Low Responsiveness |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| High Demandingness | Authoritative       | Authoritarian      |
| Low Demandingness  | Permissive          | Neglectful         |

## Attachment
- An emotional tie with others
- Freud said that you attach to the ones that feed you (mom)
	- Bro was wrong

### Styles of Attachment
- Strange Situation
	- A caregiver-infant "separation and reunion" procedure that is staged in a laboratory to test the security of a child's attachment
- Secure Attachment
	- The baby is secure when the parent is present, distressed by separation, delighted by reunion
- Insecure Attachment
	- Avoidant
	- Resistant (Anxious ambivalent)
	- Disorganized/Disoriented

### Consequences
- Form internal working models
- Secure
	- Believe in romantic love
	- Satisfying relationships
		- Happiness, friendliness, mutual trust, enduring

### Consequences - Resistant
- Emotional highs and lows
	- Obsessive preoccupation
	- Extreme sexual attraction/jealousy
	- Very willing to commit
- Conflicts
	- Most upset
	- Little support to partners in need

### Consequences - Avoidant
- Fear of intimacy
	- love is doomed to fail
- Conflicts
	- Least warm and supportive (men)
	- Sought support by hinting, sulking

## Kohlberg's Levels of Moral Reasoning
- Preconventional Level
	- Morality judged in terms of reward and punishment

- Conventional Level
	- Morality judged in terms of social order and approval

- Postconventional Level
	- Morality judged in terms of abstract principles, like equality and justice

Problems
- Effect of culture
- Behaviour vs. reasoning

## Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development
![[Pasted image 20251107213739.png]]

Problems?
- scientific verification
- cross-cultural issues

## Temperament
Individual's innate disposition or behavioural response
- Easy
- Difficult
- Slow to warm up
- Unclassifiable

## Social and Personal Development
- Peer influences
	- Conformity
	- Other-gendered peers

There isn't any difference in life satisfaction throughout life but self esteem takes the biggest hit

# Dying and Death
Elizabeth Kubler-Ross proposed five stages in approaching death (**Controversial**)
